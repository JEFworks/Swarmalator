# The Butterfly Swarmalator

This is a non-HTML5-canvas version of [The Swarmalator by Rudy Arthur](http://usediscretion.blogspot.com/2017/01/the-swarmalator.html), which is a simulation of self-organizing systems originally described by [O'Keeffe and Strogatz](https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.05670). In this adaptation, I build on Rudy's code and [my previous SVG butterfly](http://jef.works/blog/2017/11/05/animated-svg-butterfly/) to create a swarm of self-organizing butterflies.
